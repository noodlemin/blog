# Summary
- Automation: Cryptocurrency markets operate around the clock, making it challenging to monitor charts continuously. Automated tools can help execute predefined strategies without fatigue or emotional bias.
- Chart Analysis vs. News: Focusing on technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators) rather than news has several reasons:
  - Quantifiability: News is difficult to quantify and turn into actionable data.
  - Information Divide: Some individuals specialize in news analysis, making it hard for individual traders to compete effectively.
- Model Efficiency: Given the high-frequency nature of tick data, efficient models are crucial. Deep learning, while powerful, may be resource-intensive and less suitable for this context.
