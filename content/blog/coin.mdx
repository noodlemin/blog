# The Key Element of All Strategies
- **Be disciplined with stop losses**: Do not hesitate to sell when you're losing.
- Stick to the profit-loss ratio: 
# Swing Trading
- Swing trading in cryptocurrency involves buying and selling digital assets over short to medium-term periods, usually ranging from days to weeks, to profit from price fluctuations. Traders aim to take advantage of market volatility by purchasing when prices are low and selling when they rise. Unlike day trading, swing traders hold their positions for longer periods, targeting more significant price movements. This strategy relies heavily on technical analysis to identify trends and patterns, along with robust risk management to mitigate potential losses. It is favored by traders looking to benefit from market swings without the need for constant monitoring.
## Kristjan Kullamägi’s Moving Average Line Stratigie
### Background
- [**Elliott wave principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave_principle): When coin prices rise on the chart, the line typically fluctuates up and down because some people sell coins to take profits. Buy coins when the line temporarily dips, then sell when the line rises again.
### Set-up
- Allocate 10 to 20 percent of your total assets for investment. Set a stop loss at 0.5 to 1.5 percent of your total assets.
  - For example, if your assets are valued at 100 pounds, you should invest between 10 to 20 pounds and sell your coin if the loss reaches 0.5 to 1.5 pounds.
- Use Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) for 10, 20, and 50 days.
- Utilize 1-day Heikin Ashi candles for trend analysis.
### Approach

# Day Trading
- Stick with the EMA within the same time span. For instance, if the price is above the EMA on a 15-minute chart, go long. Avoid getting distracted by longer time spans like the 1-hour chart.
- The 200 EMA is a strong indicator and prices tend to bounce off it.
- Use the Stochastic RSI and volume together. High buying volume with a saturated RSI (above 80) signals a sell.
- Invest 20 percent of your budget in a single trade.
- Follow a buy-sell cycle:
  - When the price drops, buy at the current bottom and sell when it rises.
  - Even if the price continues to drop, this strategy allows you to gain some profit and reinvest, reducing losses and ensuring you have funds to buy again. This way, you can profit when the price eventually rises.
  - Aim to sell the most recent purchase by the next bar or wait until you see green bars.
  - Don't do it continuously
