# The Key Element of All Strategies
- **Be disciplined with stop losses**: Do not hesitate to sell when you're losing.
- Stick to the profit-loss ratio: 
# Swing Trading
- Swing trading in cryptocurrency involves buying and selling digital assets over short to medium-term periods, usually ranging from days to weeks, to profit from price fluctuations. Traders aim to take advantage of market volatility by purchasing when prices are low and selling when they rise. Unlike day trading, swing traders hold their positions for longer periods, targeting more significant price movements. This strategy relies heavily on technical analysis to identify trends and patterns, along with robust risk management to mitigate potential losses. It is favored by traders looking to benefit from market swings without the need for constant monitoring.
## Kristjan Kullamägi’s Moving Average Line Stratigie
### Background
- [**Elliott wave principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave_principle): When coin prices rise on the chart, the line typically fluctuates up and down because some people sell coins to take profits. Buy coins when the line temporarily dips, then sell when the line rises again.
### Set-up
- Allocate 10 to 20 percent of your total assets for investment. Set a stop loss at 0.5 to 1.5 percent of your total assets.
  - For example, if your assets are valued at 100 pounds, you should invest between 10 to 20 pounds and sell your coin if the loss reaches 0.5 to 1.5 pounds.
- Use Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) for 10, 20, and 50 days.
- Utilize 1-day Heikin Ashi candles for trend analysis.
### Approach

# Day Trading
- Stick with the EMA within the same time span. For instance, if the price is above the EMA on a 15-minute chart, go long. Avoid getting distracted by longer time spans like the 1-hour chart.
- The 200 EMA is a strong indicator and prices tend to bounce off it.
- Use the Stochastic RSI and volume together. High buying volume with a saturated RSI (above 80) signals a sell.
- Invest 20 percent of your budget in a single trade.
- Follow a buy-sell cycle:
  - When the price drops, buy at the current bottom and sell when it rises.
  - Even if the price continues to drop, this strategy allows you to gain some profit and reinvest, reducing losses and ensuring you have funds to buy again. This way, you can profit when the price eventually rises.
  - Aim to sell the most recent purchase by the next bar or wait until you see green bars.
  - Don't do it continuously




- Delay Purchases: Never buy instantly; you can always earn tomorrow.
- Short Positions: Shorting is risky because many traders buy when prices are low, driving the price up again.

## 5-Minute Bar 3-Ticks Rule
### Definition
- When a green bar turns red, count the next 3 bars to see if there are significant drops.
- After 3 bars, assess the chart and consider buying at a price you believe will rise.
  - Adjust to 2-6 ticks based on bar sizes.
  - Use a 15-minute bar if the drop is slow.
### Buying Strategy
- Buy during red bars except in specific conditions:
  - If a large green bar with high buying volume appears and the price exceeds the top Bollinger Band, take a long position.
### Details
- **Primary Rule**: Avoid losses.
  - Buy only 1/20 to 1/5 of your budget at a time to mitigate risk.
  - Aim to sell on the next bar to avoid risks like the dead cat bounce.
- **Market Analysis**: Review daily, hourly, 30-minute, and 15-minute charts to predict price movements.
- **Long Positions**: More likely to succeed as people buy when prices are perceived as low.
- **Consider Indicators**: Always factor in volume, Bollinger Bands, stochastic RSI, and other indicators.

### Plan B: Risk Management
**Avoid Buying When:**
  - Prices drop gradually.
  - All coins exhibit the same gradual drop.
  - Trading volume decreases.
**If Prices Keep Dropping After Purchase:**
- Reapply the strategy starting from 1 bar.
- Use 15-minute or 30-minute bars for gradual drops.
**In Case of Persistent Price Drops:**
- Assess the speed of the drop:
  - Slow drops suggest a later and weaker bounce.
  - Fast drops suggest an earlier and stronger bounce.
- Determine the real bottom:
  - The drop slows and price stabilizes.
  - Check the order book and market trades; if buying activity pauses and fills, it indicates the bottom.
  - Consider buying significantly at the identified bottom.
