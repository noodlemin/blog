# Definition
The use of computer programs and algorithms to execute trading strategies. These algorithms make decisions on the timing, price, and quantity of trades. They can be used for both manual and automated trading.

# Predict the Bitcoin Market with Random Forest
We'll begin by building a Random Forest model due to its strong performance and reliability. This model is particularly advantageous because it:
  - **Learns efficiently**
  - **Reduces overfitting**: By averaging multiple decision trees, the Random Forest model provides robust predictions and generalizes well to new data.

These qualities make Random Forest an excellent choice for our baseline model.
## Prerequisite
### Supervised Learning
#### Definition
- Machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. 
#### Characteristics
- **Labeled Data**: Requires a dataset where the input features are paired with the correct output (label).
- **Predictive Modeling**: The primary goal is to predict the output for new, unseen data based on what it has learned from the training data.
- **Performance Measurement**: Model accuracy is often evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification), and mean squared error (for regression).
#### Types of Supervised Learning
- Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification that predicts the probability of an outcome.
- Decision Tree: A non-linear model that splits data into branches to make decisions based on feature values.
- Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and merges them to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.

### Python Environment Setup
To build and train a Random Forest model for predicting Bitcoin prices, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment to write and run code.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: To implement the Random Forest model.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **yfinance** (Optional): To download market data.

## Create the Random Forest Model Using scikit-learn
You can find the Jupyter notebook file [here](https://github.com/noodlemin/algorithmic-trading). It is besed on the tutorial from [the stock market prediction tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O_BenficgE).
### Import Required Libraries
Before you begin, ensure that the necessary libraries are installed. You can install them using pip or conda:
``` python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import os
```
### Load Bitcoin Price Data
In this step, we'll load historical Bitcoin price data, either from a previously saved CSV file or by downloading it using yfinance.
```python
# Check if the data file already exists
if os.path.exists("BTC_USD.csv"):
    # Load the data from the CSV file
    BTC_USD = pd.read_csv("BTC_USD.csv", index_col=0)
# Download the data from Yahoo Finance if the file doesn't exist
else:
    BTC_USD = yf.Ticker("BTC-USD")
    BTC_USD = BTC_USD.history(period="max")
    # Save the downloaded data to a CSV file for future use
    BTC_USD.to_csv("BTC_USD.csv")
# Display the data to verify it's loaded correctly
del BTC_USD["Dividends"]
del BTC_USD["Stock Splits"]
BTC_USD.Headers()
```

|---------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 2014-09-17 00:00:00+00:00 | 465.864014  | 468.174011  | 452.421997  | 457.334015  | 21056800   | 
| 2014-09-18 00:00:00+00:00 | 456.859985  | 456.859985  | 413.104004  | 424.440002  | 34483200   |
| 2014-09-19 00:00:00+00:00 | 424.102997  | 427.834991  | 384.532013  | 394.795990  | 37919700   |
| 2014-09-20 00:00:00+00:00 | 394.673004  | 423.295990  | 389.882996  | 408.903992  | 36863600   |

### Plot Bitcoin Price Data
```python
BTC_USD.plot.line(y="Close", use_index=True)
```
![history_plot](/images/algorithmic-trading/output.png)

### Add Tomorrow and Target Columns
The "Tomorrow" column helps to know what the closing price will be on the next day for each row.
The "Target" column indicates whether the price went up the next day (1 for yes, 0 for no), which can be used as a target variable in a machine learning model to predict price movements.
```python
BTC_USD["Tomorrow"] = BTC_USD["Close"].shift(-1)
BTC_USD["Target"] = (BTC_USD["Tomorrow"] > BTC_USD["Close"]).astype(int)
```

### Train the Model
The code initializes a RandomForestClassifier with 100 trees, splits the Bitcoin dataset into training and test sets, selects key features (Close, Volume, Open, High, Low) as predictors, and trains the model on the training data to predict whether the Bitcoin price will increase or decrease.
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
# n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest; increasing this generally improves accuracy but can slow down the model.
# min_samples_split: Controls the tree depth; higher values reduce overfitting but might slightly decrease accuracy.
# random_state: Sets a seed for reproducibility.
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, min_samples_split=100, random_state=1)
# We use past data for training and future data for testing to avoid leakage issues. 
train = BTC_USD.iloc[:-100]
test = BTC_USD.iloc[-100:]
# Define the features (predictors) to be used in the model
predictors = ["Close", "Volume", "Open", "High", "Low"]
```

### Evaluate the Model
[The precision](https://scikit-learn.org/0.15/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html) is the ratio tp / (tp + fp) where tp is the number of true positives and fp the number of false positives. The precision is intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample that is negative.
```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score

def predict(train, test, predictors, model):
    # Train the model using the defined features and the target variable
    model.fit(train[predictors], train["Target"])
    preds = model.predict(test[predictors])
    # Convert the numpy array to the pandas Series
    preds = pd.Series(preds, index=test.index, name="Predictions")
    # np.float64(0.5652173913043478)
    precision_score(test["Target"], preds)
    combined = pd.concat([test["Target"], preds], axis=1)
    return combined

# Plot the result
predict(train, test, predictors, model).plot()
```

### Backtesting
Backtesting is a method used to evaluate how well a trading strategy or financial model would have performed in the past. It involves applying the strategy to historical market data to see how it would have fared if it had been used during that time period.

In this backtesting approach, we use the first 5 years of data (1825 days) to predict the 6th year’s data. Subsequently, we use the first 6 years of data to predict the 7th year’s data, and so on. The provided Python function, backtest, performs this iterative process:
```python
def backtest(data, model, predictors, start=1825, step=365):
    all_predictions = []

    for i in range(start, data.shape[0], step):
        train = data.iloc[0:i].copy()
        test = data.iloc[i:(i+step)].copy()
        predictions = predict(train, test, predictors, model)
        all_predictions.append(predictions)
    
    return pd.concat(all_predictions)

predictions = backtest(BTC_USD, model, predictors)
# Predictions
# 0    1031
# 1     769
# Name: count, dtype: int64
predictions["Predictions"].value_counts()
# np.float64(0.5006501950585176)
precision_score(predictions["Target"], predictions["Predictions"])
# Target
# 1    0.505
# 0    0.495
# Name: count, dtype: float64
predictions["Target"].value_counts() / predictions.shape[0]
```
Here if we say price goes up everyday, 50.07 percent chance it is correct.



# Trading Terms
### S&P 500 (Standard & Poor's 500)
A stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. It is widely regarded as one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market and the broader economy. The companies included in the S&P 500 are selected based on their market capitalization, liquidity, and industry representation, among other factors. The index is used by investors to gauge the overall health of the stock market and as a benchmark for investment performance.

## RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- Meaning: RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market.
- Formula: RSI = 100 - [100 / (1 + RS)], where RS = Average Gain / Average Loss over a specified period.
- Usage:
  - RSI values above 70 generally indicate that an asset is overbought.
  - RSI values below 30 suggest that an asset is oversold.
- Period: Typically calculated over 14 periods.

## BB (Bollinger Bands)
- Meaning: Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator consisting of a middle band (usually a simple moving average) and two outer bands that are standard deviations away from the middle band.
- Formula:
  - Middle Band = 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average)
  - Upper Band = Middle Band + 2 * 20-day Standard Deviation
  - Lower Band = Middle Band - 2 * 20-day Standard Deviation
- Usage:
  - Prices touching the upper band may indicate an overbought condition.
  - Prices touching the lower band may indicate an oversold condition.
  - Bollinger Bands can also signal volatility, with the bands expanding during high volatility and contracting during low volatility.
