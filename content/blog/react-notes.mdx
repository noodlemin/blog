# Definition
React is a JavaScript library for building interactive UIs, developed by Facebook. It uses a component-based structure to create reusable, efficient interfaces and handles only the view layer of apps. With React, UIs are built as small components that manage their own state. The virtual DOM ensures fast updates, and Reactâ€™s unidirectional data flow makes it easy to track changes.
