# Summary
This project focuses on developing the official company website. It's built with a modern web stack to ensure a fast, responsive, and engaging user experience across all devices. We've prioritized a clean, intuitive design and smooth animations to effectively showcase our land development projects and company vision.

This project is my implementation of [the Awwwards-style website tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA9r5zTllx4&t=3625s) created by JavaScript Mastery.

# Core Technologies
## GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
GSAP is used for creating highly performant and complex animations. From subtle hover effects to dynamic section transitions, GSAP delivers smooth, hardware-accelerated animations that elevate the user experience and add a layer of polish to the site.

# Prerequsites
- React

# Project Setup
Initialize a React project and install the necessary dependencies.

## Node.js
You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). It allows developers to use JavaScript to write command-line tools and, most importantly, server-side scripts. This means you can use the same language for both the front-end and back-end of a website, streamlining the development process.
## Vite
Vite is a next-generation frontend build tool that offers an extremely fast development experience due to its native ES module-based dev server and lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Create your project folder, then run the following script in your command line in your newly created project folder.
```bash
npm create vite@latest ./
```
Select React, and then decide between JavaScript or TypeScript.
## TailwindCSS
We'll be using version 3. Please follow the instructions provided [here](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).
## GSAP and other dependencies
```bash
npm install gsap @gsap/react 
npm install --save clsx react-icons
```

# Sections
## Hero
This section covers the construction of an animated hero section in React. The final component features a video transition system, a 3D parallax hover effect, and a scroll-based `clip-path` animation.

**Technologies Used:**
- React (with `@gsap/react` hook)
- GSAP (`ScrollTrigger` plugin)
- Tailwind CSS
