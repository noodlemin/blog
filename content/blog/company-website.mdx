# Summary
This project focuses on developing the official company website. It's built with a modern web stack to ensure a fast, responsive, and engaging user experience across all devices. We've prioritized a clean, intuitive design and smooth animations to effectively showcase our land development projects and company vision.

## Hero
This section covers the construction of an animated hero section in React. The final component features a video transition system, a 3D parallax hover effect, and a scroll-based `clip-path` animation.

**Technologies Used:**
- React (with `@gsap/react` hook)
- GSAP (`ScrollTrigger` plugin)
- Tailwind CSS

## Project Setup

```bash
# Using Next.js

## GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
GSAP is used for creating highly performant and complex animations. From subtle hover effects to dynamic section transitions, GSAP delivers smooth, hardware-accelerated animations that elevate the user experience and add a layer of polish to the site.
