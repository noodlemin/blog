# Summary
This project focuses on developing the official company website. It's built with a modern web stack to ensure a fast, responsive, and engaging user experience across all devices. We've prioritized a clean, intuitive design and smooth animations to effectively showcase our land development projects and company vision.

This project is my implementation of the Awwwards-style website tutorial created by JavaScript Mastery.

# Core Technologies
## GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
GSAP is used for creating highly performant and complex animations. From subtle hover effects to dynamic section transitions, GSAP delivers smooth, hardware-accelerated animations that elevate the user experience and add a layer of polish to the site.

# Project Setup
Initialize a React project and install the necessary dependencies.

## Node.js
You need to install Node.js. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write command-line tools and, most importantly, server-side scripts. This means you can use the same language for both the front-end and back-end of a website, streamlining the development process.

## Vite
Vite is a next-generation frontend build tool that offers an extremely fast development experience due to its native ES module-based dev server and lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Create your project folder, then run the following script in your command line in your newly created project folder.

``` Bash
npm create vite@latest ./
```
Select React, and then decide between JavaScript or TypeScript.

## TailwindCSS
We'll be using version 3. Please follow the instructions provided here.

## GSAP and other dependencies
``` Bash
npm install gsap @gsap/react
npm install --save clsx react-icons
```

# Sections
## Hero
This component's architecture combines multiple GSAP techniques: state-driven animations via the useGSAP hook, scroll-linked animations using ScrollTrigger, and 3D transforms for interactive parallax effects.

**Technologies Used**:

* React (with @gsap/react hook)

* GSAP (ScrollTrigger plugin)

* Tailwind CSS

### Trouble Shooting

* Video Resolution on iOS: Videos must have a consistent resolution (e.g., 1920x1080) to prevent layout issues on iOS devices.

* iOS Inline Playback: The **playsInline** attribute is essential for videos to play within the page on iOS instead of going full-screen.


## About
The **About** section initially featured a word-by-word animation that caused performance issues and scroll-jumping on mobile browsers. After several attempts to fix it with GSAP and **react-intersection-observer**, the most stable solution was to replace it with a robust, pure CSS animation that triggers on load to prioritize a smooth user experience.

## NavBar
### Language Switch
To implement multilingual support, the following dependencies were installed:

``` Bash
npm install i18next react-i18next i18next-browser-languagedetector
```
A **LanguageLayout** component was created to manage language changes based on the URL, ensuring a seamless experience for international users.

### Vercel Deployment
To fix the "404 Not Found" error when refreshing a dynamic route page on Vercel, a vercel.json file was created to handle client-side routing rewrites.

## Portfolio
### Polishing the Interactive Map
Building a dynamic, interactive map is a fantastic way to showcase a portfolio of properties. As I developed our portfolio page using React and Kakao Maps, I encountered several common but tricky bugs that affected the user experience. This post details the problems I found and the solutions I implemented to create a smoother, more professional map interface.

1. Info Window Text Overflow
(Instruction: For a bulleted list, start each line with * followed by a space. To make part of a line bold, wrap it in double asterisks **.)

* Problem: When an info window was opened, long descriptions would not wrap correctly, breaking the layout.

* Solution: The definitive fix was to apply the Tailwind utility **break-all**, which forces a line break at any character to ensure the text always stays within its container.


2. Mobile Usability: Info Window Obscuring the Marker
* Problem: On mobile screens, the info window at the top of the map would completely cover the marker the user had just tapped.

* Solution: I implemented a check within the **handleMarkerClick** function. On screens narrower than 1024px, after the map pans to the marker, an additional **map.panBy(0, -150)** command shifts the map's center up, moving the selected marker down into the visible area.

3. Map Centering "Race Condition" on Marker Click
* Problem: Clicking a new marker while the map was still zoomed in from a previous interaction caused a conflict between the **setLevel** and **panTo** animations, resulting in the map failing to center correctly.

* Solution: The fix was to remove the animation from the zoom command by changing **map.setLevel(5, ```{ animate: true }```)** to just **map.setLevel(5)**. This makes the zoom level change instantly, allowing the pan animation to execute smoothly without conflict.


4. Dynamic Viewport: Auto-Fitting Markers on Filter Change
* Problem: When a user clicked a filter button, the markers updated, but the map's zoom and center remained the same, often leaving the relevant markers out of view.

* Solution: A **useEffect** hook now triggers whenever the filters change. It calculates the optimal map boundaries to encompass all visible markers and automatically adjusts the map's view using **map.setBounds()**.


5. UI/UX: Moving from Map Overlay to a Fixed Info Window
* Problem: The initial info window was a **CustomOverlayMap**, which is tied directly to a map coordinate and can be visually cluttered.

* Solution: I refactored the design to use a fixed-position info window that renders on top of the map container (**position: absolute**). This provides a more stable, dashboard-like feel.

6. Code Maintainability: Reusable Data Structure
* Problem: The **properties** data array was defined directly inside the **Portfolio** component, making it hard to reuse.

* Solution: I extracted all property-related data and helper functions into a separate **src/data/properties.js** file. The **Portfolio** component now simply imports this data, making the code cleaner and more modular.

## Contact
The contact page includes a form integrated with **emailjs** for direct email submission.

### Legal (Privacy)
A single **Legal** page was created to house both the Privacy Policy and the "Refusal of Unauthorized Email Collection" notice. The component uses URL hashes (**#privacy**, **#noemail**) and React state to toggle between the two sections, providing a clean and consolidated user experience.
